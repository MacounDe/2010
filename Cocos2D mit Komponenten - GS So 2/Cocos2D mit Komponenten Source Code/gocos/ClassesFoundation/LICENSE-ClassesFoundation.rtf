\b0 This folder contains all source code which can be considered cocos2d engine extensions, for example modified Actions, additional UI elements and other code that directly subclasses cocos2d engine classes. The folder also contains generally useful code for any game, for example debug output, rendering of OpenGL primitives, code that reads/writes configuration files, anti-piracy measures and of course a general purpose AppDelegate.\
